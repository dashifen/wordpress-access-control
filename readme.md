# WordPress Access Control

A plugin to limit access to posts in WordPress to particular users.

Realistically, this is just a playground.  The idea came up during a 
conversation for my day job and I wanted to play around and see how I might
accomplish the task for myself.  My recommendation would be to actually use any
of the number of other plugins that do this work likely better than how I 
put it together in my spare time 😁
